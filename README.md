# Candle Animation Comparison Project

## Project Overview
This project compares 10 different AI-generated implementations of a CSS candle animation based on the original prompt. It serves as a technical comparison of how various AI models interpret and implement the same animation requirements.

### Original Prompt
```text
Create a white candle with a single flame using only pure CSS and HTML. The flame should be animated with realistic movement and have a small space between it and the candle. The sparks should also be animated with smooth movements. Ensure the overall design is visually appealing and lifelike.
```

### Key Features
- 10 different AI implementations
- Side-by-side comparison interface
- Pure CSS animations
- Responsive dark-mode design
- Detailed implementation notes
- Interactive previews
- Cross-browser compatibility
